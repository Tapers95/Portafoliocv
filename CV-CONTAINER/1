PROFESSIONAL PHILOSOPHY & PROFILE
"I don't just follow rules; I decode them to create new realities."
Innovative professional with a dual-background in industrial manufacturing and logistics. Unlike traditional managers, I apply First Principles thinking and Human-AI Integration to deconstruct operational chaos and rebuild it into scalable systems. My methodology transforms complex bottlenecks into functional, elegant solutions.
 * Core Value: Attitude over Aptitude. I leverage Prompt Engineering not just as a tool, but as a cognitive extension to analyze data and optimize workflows faster than standard logic allows.
FEATURED PILOT PROJECT
Case Study: AI-Powered Route Optimization
 * The Challenge: Inefficient traffic patterns hidden within raw data were causing delivery delays.
 * The Disruption: Instead of relying on manual planning, I utilized AI tools to identify non-obvious bottlenecks.
 * The Result: Designed a dynamic routing model that achieved a 30% reduction in cycle times, proving that algorithmic logic beats traditional intuition.

PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
EK LOGISTICS | Logistics Coordinator & Fleet Trainer
December 2023 – November 2024
 * Scaled Order from Chaos: Orchestrated a 160% fleet expansion (from 3 to 8 units) in under 12 months, maintaining operational stability during a hyper-growth phase that would break traditional structures.
 * Algorithmic Optimization: Challenged established routing methods by implementing data-driven planning, resulting in a 30% reduction in average delivery times.
 * Data-Driven Fidelity: Mastered the Scpack (Mercado Libre) platform to monitor hidden KPIs, ensuring a 100% service fulfillment rate and identifying bottlenecks before they impacted the client.
 * Human-System Integration: Spearheaded a rigorous onboarding program for 18+ members, proving that rapid scaling can coexist with standardized safety and operational excellence.
ASTRO REFRIGERACIÓN | General Production Manager & Design Lead
January 2019 – November 2023
 * Quality Assurance System: Led a team of 15 technicians, implementing a quality control loop that decreased production defects by 15%.
 * End-to-End Execution: Directed the full manufacturing lifecycle, from conceptual sketches to final commissioning, ensuring the bridge between design intent and physical reality.
 * Technical Mastery: Executed high-precision manufacturing, including advanced welding (Arc, Autogenous, Argon) and blueprint interpretation.
EDUCATION & CONTINUOUS EVOLUTION
Independent Strategic Researcher & Tech Autodidact
2024 – Present
 * Focus: Advanced application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for business process optimization and performance metric extraction.
 * Methodology: Self-directed "Continuous Re-learning" program. I prioritize adaptable intelligence over static academic syllabi.
 * Certifications: Google Career Certificates (Data & Tech).
